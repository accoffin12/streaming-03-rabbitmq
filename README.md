# Overview: 
This project requires some free code - beyond that available in the Python Standard Library. To avoid messing up our local default Python installation, and any other Python projects we may have, we  create a local virtual environment to install and use these libraries.

Think of a virtual environment as a safe sandbox. 
We can install whatever we want in our sandbox, and it won't break other Python projects that may require different versions, etc. 

We use the built-in Python utility `venv` to create our virtual environment. 
There are other options, but this is simplest and most common. 
We create the environment as a subfolder of this repo named .venv to keep it away from our project code. 

**_Note:_**
In order to fully understand this repository please read through the tutorials offered on the RabbitMQ page. These will provide an outline and explination into the different features, functions and calls that are required to run RabbitMQ.

## Prerequisites
1. Git
2. Python 3.7+ (3.11+ preferred)
3. VS Code Editor
4. VS Code Extension: Python (by Microsoft)
5. RabbitMQ Server installed and running locally

## Before You Begin

1. Fork this starter repo into your GitHub account.
2. Clone your repo down to your machine.
3. Explore your new project repo in VS Code on your local machine.

# Executing the Repository: 
## 1. Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment

We will create a local Python virtual environment to isolate our project's third-party dependencies from other projects.

1. Open a terminal window in VS Code.
1. Use the built-in Python utility venv to create a new virtual environment named `.venv` in the current directory.

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

Verify you get a new .venv directory in your project. 
We use .venv as the name to keep it away from our project files. 

In the same VS Code terminal window, activate the virtual environment.

- On Windows, run: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
- On Linux/MacOS, run: `source .venv/bin/activate`

Verify you see the virtual environment name (.venv) in your terminal prompt.

## 2. Install Dependencies into the Virtual Environment

To work with RabbitMQ, we need to install the pika library.
A library is a collection of code that we can use in our own code.
Learning to use free libraries that others have written to make our projects easier, faster, more reliable is a key skill for a developer.

We keep the list of third-party libraries needed in a file named requirements.txt.
Use the pip utility to install the libraries listed in requirements.txt into our active virtual environment. 

Make sure you can see the .venv name in your terminal prompt before running this:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### A. Pika:
Pika is a Python implimentation of the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol or AMQP 0-9-1. It supports Python 3.7 + and allows us to utilize RabbitMQ. Additionally Pika does not require threads, but the core will not forbid them if used. This Library enables the user to address greenlets, callbacks, continuation and generators. Multiple connectsions are also possible through the instance pika.ConnectionParameters, this includes control over connection attemps and retry delays. 

Finally it is important to note that when Pika is requresting message acknowledgements from another thread that an individual Pika connection adapter instance may result in a dropped AMQP/stream connection due to a heartbeat timeout in consumers that take too long to process the incoming message. Pika allows for delegation of processing incomming messages to another thread while the connection adapter thread continues to service the message pump to maintain timly responces. The code running on the secondary thread may requrest the ack_message() function to be exicuted in the connection adapter's thread. There are several mechanics to do this the ones highlightted in this repository are:

```
pika.BlockingConnection() 
pika.ConnectionParameters() 
auto_ack 
```
For full list of protected terms, classes and functions see [Official Pika Documentation](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
| Pika Class and Modules| Type | Use |
| ---------- |  ---------- | ---------- |
| BlockingConnection() | Class | A synchonous adapter for abstracting the I/O loop from the application and exposes the connection|
| ConnectionParameters() | Class| Encapsulated Authentication Credentials allowing us to dictate the Host. |
| ack_message | function | Executed int he connection adapters loop using a specific mechanism, it is possible to automatically generate using auto_ack. |
| Channel | Class | Used to communicated with RabbitMQ via AMQP RPC methods, it is the primary communication method for interacting with RabbitMQ. |

## 3. Verify Setup

In your VS Code terminal window, run the following commands to help verify your setup.
These util files MAY be helpful to ensure you're setup correctly. 
You may have a different configuration and RabbitMQ may still work; the check looks in common places, but may not work for all installations. 
They are meant to be helpful, but are not required.

```shell
python util_about.py
python util_aboutenv.py
python util_aboutrabbit.py
pip list
```

Note: The util_aboutrabbit.py will only work on machine's with Cholocaty installed. Windows requires a different locator to find where Rabbit has been isntalled.

## 4. Read Producer and Consumer Templates
Read the code and comments in our 2 project files: emit_send.py and listen_recieve.py

Don't worry if it doesn't all make sense the first time. 
Approach it like a puzzle and see what you can figure out. Examine how functions are assembled as well as use of Pika, this will assist in understanding Steps 6 through 7. Especially pay attention to the use of the Pika library such as: `connection`, `channel`, `queue_declare` and `basic_publish`. Each of these is critical to code running properly. Please see the section [A. Pika](A._Pika) for a information on the library as well as official documentation.  

# Version 1:
## 5. Execute the Producer/Sender

1. Read v1_emit_message.py (and the tutorial)
2. Run the file. 

It will run, emit a message to the named RabbitMQ queue, and finish.
We can execute additional commands in the terminal as soon as it finishes. 
Be sure that **_RabbitMQ is running_** while exicuting these comands, otherwise the scripts will not run. 


## 6. Execute the Consumer/Listener

1. Read v1_listen_for_messages.py (and the tutorial)
2. Run the file.

When running both scripts in a split terminal, the results should look as follows. The terminal on the left is running emit_sent.py and the terminal on the right is running listern_recieve.py. Notice how both of these terminals are responding. That the message from the left (emit) can be seen being recieved on the right (listen). To terminate the code utilize the built in termination call, Ctrl + C. This will end the streaming process. Also recall that each terminal is treated like an individual queue, so when altering messages save the code and open a new terminal. 

As long as the process is running the terminal can not be used for other commands.

## 7. Open a New Terminal / Emit More Messages

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Use this new window to run emit_message.py again.
3. Watch the listing terminal - what do you see?  A second message?

![3 Terminals running 1 emit_send and 2 listen_recieve](/ProjectScreenShots/v1RunMultiTeminals.PNG "v1 Running with Multiple Terminals")

The second message that can be seen is a waiting message, as the script emit_send.py only contains a single message and routing key. Meaning that even though we have sent a message using terminal 1, we did not send a fanout message - which ignores these keys. Instead the message was direct and recieved by the intended queue - terminal 2. Therefore Terminal 3 will wait until Terminal 1 has run the script again to send the message. 

Sending the same message each time is kind of boring. This time:

4. Where is the message defined? How can you change it?
5. Modify emit_message.py to emit a different message. 
6. Execute the updated emit_message.py. 
7. Watch what happens in the listening terminal.

Repeat this process several times - emit at least 4 different messages.
Don't worry - it's just code. We can always revert back (try the 'undo' command in VS Code) to a version that works. You can't hurt anything. 

While maintaing the origianl queues and terminal any message that's modified within this specific script will send to the original pair of terminals meaning. Even though the contents of the message are different each time, and alterations to the body have to be done - so long as the recieving queues have the same key then the message will be recieved on these queues.

## 8. Save Time & Effort: Don't Repeat Yourself

Did you notice you had to change the message in TWO places?

1. You update the actual message sent. 
2. You also update what is displayed to the user. 
3. Fix this by introducing a variable to hold the message. 
4. Use your variable when sending. 
5. Use the variable again when displaying to the user. 

Now, to send a new message, you'll only make ONE change.
Updating and improving code is called 'refactoring'. 
Use your skills to keep coding enjoyable. 

# Version 2

Now look at the second version of each file.
These include more graceful error handling,
and a consistent, reusable approach to building code.

Each of the version 2 programs include an error as well. 

1. Find the error and fix it. 
1. Compare the structure of the version 2 files. 
1. Modify the docstrings on all your files.
1. Include your name and the date.
1. Imports always go at the top, just after the file docstring.
1. Imports should be one per line - why?
1. Then, define your functions.
1. Functions are reusable logic blocks.
1. Everything the function needs comes in through the arguments.
1. A function may - or may not - return a value. 
1. When we open a connection, we should close the connection. 
1. Which of the 4 files will always close() the connection?
1. Search GitHub for if __name__ == "__main__":
1. How many hits did you get? 
1. Learn and understand this common Python idiom.
